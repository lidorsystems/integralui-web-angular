<b>Filter</b> - Includes a set of related functions for filter operations


All components are inheritable, you can further extend functionalities of specific component by simple create a subclass of component main class. To get access to a specific component, the best way is to import the IntegralUIModule in your application.

## Dependencies

IntegralUI Web requires only the following library:

Angular - v9.0 and above


## DEMO

[Online QuickStart App](https://www.lidorsystems.com/products/web/studio/samples/angular/) - An online demo of each component included


## Installation

Install the repository by running

```bash
npm install https://github.com/lidorsystems/integralui-web.git
```

or directly from NPM

```bash
npm i @lidorsystems/integralui-web
```

Open your application module and add a reference to IntegralUI module. Use a relative path to the module location:

```bash
import { IntegralUIModule } from '../../node_modules/@lidorsystems/integralui-web/bin/integralui/integralui.module';

@NgModule({
  imports:      [ IntegralUIModule ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

<b>Note</b>   In order to use a specific component or directive in your application, follow the [guidelines from corresponding article](https://www.lidorsystems.com/support/help/web/angular/guide/articles.aspx). You can find a separate article available for each component or directive.

### Angular CLI

After installation, in angular.json under styles section add this code line:

```bash
"node_modules/@lidorsystems/integralui-web/bin/integralui/css/integralui.module.css"
```

To apply a theme, also add code line for corresonding theme file:
```bash
"node_modules/@lidorsystems/integralui-web/bin/integralui/themes/integralui.themes.office.css"
```

<b>Note</b>   You can choose a theme from available themes located at '~ ... /integralui/themes' folder.

### How to Reduce Bundle Size

If you are using only few components from the InetgralUI Web package, you can reduce the bundle size during compilation by modifying the <b>integralui.module.css</b> file. This file imports CSS files for each component that is part of the package. Inside this file import only CSS for components that you are using.

For example, if you are using only the TreeView component in your app, comment out all other imports for individual components, except for the TreeView component. The result should look like this:

```
/* General settings */
@import 'integralui.css';
@import 'integralui.dragdrop.css';
@import 'integralui.editing.css';
@import 'integralui.filter.css';
@import 'integralui.sorting.css';

/* Component settings */
@import 'integralui.treeview.css';


/*
 * Comment out all other CSS files
 *

@import 'integralui.accordion.css';
@import 'integralui.autocomplete.css';
@import 'integralui.breadcrumb.css';

. . .

*/
```

You should keep the General Settings section in CSS, it is used by all components.

As a final result, after compilation the build size will be greatly reduced.

### Creating Custom Styles for IntegralUI Components

When you create custom styles or changes to built-in CSS classes of IntegralUI components, placed for example within app.component.css file, make sure ViewEncapsulation is set to None. This allows to override default settings from corresponding component css file. For example:

<b>app.component.ts</b>

```bash
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
})
export class AppComponent {
}
```

<b>app.component.css</b>

```bash
.iui-treeview
{
  width: 400px;
  height: 300px;
}
```

In this example, the TreeView component will have its width and height set from within the app.component. 

<b>Note</b>   Changes to ViewEncapsulation set to None is avoidable, if you create your own CSS style sheet and include it in angular.json file under styles section. Like it is explained above for general IntegralUI styles.

## QuickStart App

There is a demo application with source code that contains samples for each component included in the [IntegralUI Web](https://www.lidorsystems.com/products/web/studio/) product package. It can help you to get started quickly with learning about the components and write tests immediatelly.

In order to start this application, you only need to install the latest Angular library. Open the nodejs command prompt, go to application directory and type:

```bash
    npm install
```
After installation completes, start the application by typing:

```bash
    ng serve --open
```

The application will start displaying the main window with links to all components included. Each component window contains a demo and description about the component functionality. You can checkout the sample source code (located under integralui-web/quickstart/src/app/samples subfolder) for more information on the sample and component used.
